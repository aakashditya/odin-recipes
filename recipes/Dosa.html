                <li>¼ teaspoon methi seeds (fenugreek seeds)</li>   
                    
                <li>1 cup water for soaking rice</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>20. With the ladle gently begin to spread the batter in round circles. If the pan is very hot, you won’t be able to spread the batter in a round circle. So for a nonstick pan, just lift the pan from the flame and keep outside for some seconds or half a minute. Then again place it on the fire</p>
                <p>For a iron griddle, you can sprinkle some water on the pan. This reduces the temperature of the cast iron griddle. Please do not sprinkle water on non stick pan. The non stick coating can wear off.</p>
            <li>Spread the batter to a neat, round shaped thin dosa.</li>
            <li>On a low to medium flame, begin to cook.</li>
            <li>Let the top side get cooked.</li>
            <li>Then with a spoon drizzle and spread some oil on the dosa. you can add less or more oil as per your requirements.</li>
            <li> Keep cooking till you see the base becoming golden. The more the base becomes golden, the paper dosa becomes more crisp</li>
            <li>Now with a spatula fold the crisp paper dosa</li>
            <li>serve paper dosa with coconut chutney and sambar</li>
        </ol>
